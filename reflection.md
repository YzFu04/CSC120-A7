- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

    - In Cafe class, I overload the sellCoffee(size, sugar, cream) method to sellCoffee(size, sugar, cream, cup) and sellCoffee(size). The first one is created for multiple cups of coffee, and the second one is for a cup of coffee with default value of sugar and cream.
    - In Library class, I overload the printCollection() method to printCollection(currentStatus) and printCollection(keyword). The first one enables to print collection of available books or collection of unavilable books, the second one allows to print collection of books with specific keywords.
    - In House class, I overload the isResident(person) method to isResident(personA, personB) and isResident(). The first one can check if two people are the residents of the house, the second one will print out all residents in the house.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    - I have a sense about how inheritance and override, overload would work to make an aggregation of classes.
